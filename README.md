# 1: AutoSearcher

Automatically searches 30 times to gain 90 points. Be sure to unblock popups in the top right corner (right side of search bar).  

This is made possible by searching random values and opening thirty different search links.  

This program should be run in the console (inspect element). When the program is finished running, click the first tab, then Shift+Click the last tab to close all tabs in the selected range.

**More automatied programs for MS rewards arriving soon.**
